Each testset comprised of 60 sentences, for a total of 180 sentencescorresponding to 893,950 T-F units\u000135,758 frames\u000325 fre-quency bands\u0002for the male-speaker sentences and 811,750T-F units\u000132 470\u000325 frequency bands\u0002for the female-speaker sentences. HIT and FA rates were computed by com-paring the estimated binary mask against the\u0001oracle\u0002IdBM.TableIshows the results obtained using sGMM and mGMMmodels in the various masker conditions. High hit rates\u0001low-est with factory noise at 0 dB, male speaker; 75.18%\u0002andlow false-alarm rates\u0001highest with factory noise at −5 dB,female speaker; 17.26%\u0002were obtained with sGMM models.The hit rate obtained with mGMM models was about 10%lower than that of sGMM models for the male speaker. Thedifference was much smaller for the female speaker\u0001about5%\u0002. As demonstrated inLi and Loizou,\u00012008b\u0002, low falsealarm rates\u0001\u000620% assuming high hit rates\u0002are required toachieve high levels of speech intelligibility.\n",
